## Changing the source code

If you want to change the source code, feel free.
Ideas I have include:
- Change the way the user is authenticated. Doing it via authorising via the browser is better for the end user, 
however I only know to do it via application keys.

## Testing

The code is only tested by me currently. From what I can tell, it fully works, but more testing is always appreciated.

## Filter

The filter list could always do with an update.
